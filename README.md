## Simply skin your Aplication with just writing one line of code,\(OCX\)


</div>

### Description

Skin your Aplication with just writing one line of code, and this OCX (Full code included).

Hi, this is the first time I send a code. I hope you like it.

It has 2-in-1 controls: 1)The Skin 2)An special command button.

There're 2 major problems:

1.If anyone knows how I can handle the standart menu (with an API) to move it to a

new XY position, please let me know.(It doesn't support menues)

2.I need to modify the form properties (the BorderStyle to 1) to make it minimize in the taskbar.

If you know how, it could be automatized inside de control (by an API).

Sorry for my english... :(

See, you.
